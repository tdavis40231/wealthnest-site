Managing money with a biblical lens isn’t just wise — it’s worship. When we create a budget, we’re taking dominion over our finances and showing God we’re serious about stewardship.

Here’s how to start building a biblically rooted budget that also works in real life:
1. Start with prayer
2. List all sources of income
3. Tithe first, not last
4. Assign purpose to every dollar
5. Review monthly and adjust

Budgeting isn’t about restriction — it’s about intention. When we budget with God in mind, we find freedom, not fear.
