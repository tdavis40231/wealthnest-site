College life can leave you spiritually hungry and financially empty — but it doesn’t have to stay that way. Here’s how to align your faith with practical steps toward financial peace:

1. Surrender your finances to God
2. Track your spending (yes, all of it)
3. Create a simple starter budget
4. Learn the power of contentment (Philippians 4:11)
5. Avoid credit card debt like the plague
6. Find a mentor who’s been there
7. Celebrate small wins with gratitude

Being broke is a season. Waking up to God’s principles brings long-term wealth — both spiritual and financial.
