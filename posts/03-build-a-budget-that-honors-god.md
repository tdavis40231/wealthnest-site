A godly budget isn’t restrictive — it’s freeing. Here’s how to craft one that puts God first and still handles real-world obligations:

- **Tithe First**: Give God your firstfruits (Proverbs 3:9)
- **Essentials Next**: Housing, food, transportation, and utilities
- **Debt & Savings**: Pay down what you owe while storing up wisdom (Proverbs 21:20)
- **Fun & Flexibility**: Budget margin for joy — guilt-free and God-honoring

Remember: your budget should reflect your values. When God is in your spreadsheet, peace shows up in your heart.
