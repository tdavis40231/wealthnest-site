Not all extra income is created equal. Here are 5 low-stress, faith-friendly side hustles:

1. Virtual assistant for Christian businesses
2. Printables on Etsy (like prayer journals)
3. Tutoring or mentoring students
4. Freelance writing (blogging, devotionals, resumes)
5. Digital product creation (budget planners, eBooks)

Choose work that aligns with your values, protects your peace, and leaves room for Sabbath rest.
