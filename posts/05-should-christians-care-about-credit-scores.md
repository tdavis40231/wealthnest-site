title: "Should Christians Care About Credit Scores?"

Credit scores aren’t a spiritual scorecard — but they can impact your stewardship. Here’s why it matters:

- Renting an apartment
- Applying for a job
- Starting a business
- Getting lower interest rates

The Bible warns about debt (Romans 13:8), not credit scores themselves. Use credit as a tool, not a trap — and never let it define your identity.
